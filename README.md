This is an example application to demenstrate [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Retrieval-augmented_generation) in [Traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters).

We used [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as the interface, [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) as the application framework, and [OpenAI-API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) as the LLM and embedding model provider. That is to say, you will need a valid OPENAI-API-KEY to run this example on its default settings. You can modify the code to use alternative models.

To avoid copyright issues, this demo provided RAG of the Bible. The [《國語和合本聖經》](https://www.translatebible.com/chinese_union_version.html) is a translation of the [English Revised Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Version) of the Bible published in 1919 and is currently belong to the public domain.
